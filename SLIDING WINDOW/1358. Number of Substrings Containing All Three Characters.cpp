/*
    Logic:
        1. From the question we understand that it is a sliding window problem.
        2. abcabc -> Our first valid window is abc where i = 0 and j = 2 but from index i once more valid window is abca, abcb, abcabc so totla three strings which i.e n-j number of substrings starting from index i -> Very important point to remember.
    Time Complexity:
        1. T.C -> O(2*n) since we are vising each character at most twice.
        2. Point to remember is that while applying sliding window always remember that each character is visited atmost twice.
    Space Complexity:
        1. s.C -> O(3) since we are using an unordered_map as an auxiliary space.
